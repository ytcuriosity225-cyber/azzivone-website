You are a senior frontend architect and product designer.

Task:
Create a FRONTEND-ONLY Admin Dashboard (no backend, no database, no APIs yet) for an existing luxury skincare brand website named “Azzivone”.

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT BREAK):
1. Do NOT modify, delete, refactor, or redesign any existing pages, sections, styles, colors, fonts, or components of the live website.
2. This admin panel must be a NEW, SEPARATE page/module (e.g. /admin or admin.html).
3. The admin panel is VISUAL + INTERACTIVE only (mock data, placeholders).
4. All controls are UI-only (no real functionality yet).
5. Match existing brand colors, fonts, spacing, and luxury aesthetic exactly.
6. Do NOT use black backgrounds or new color palettes.
7. Keep everything minimal, clean, quiet-luxury style.
