Objective:
Create a high-conversion Product Page that sits between the Home Page and Checkout Page, acting as a decision-accelerator. This page must emotionally convince, visually prove, and smoothly route users to checkout.

🔗 PAGE LINKING & FLOW (CRITICAL)

All CTA buttons on Home Page (Order Now / Buy Now / Get Started / etc.) must redirect to this Product Page.

All primary CTAs on the Product Page must redirect to the Checkout Page.

No dead ends. Smooth, linear funnel:
Home → Product Page → Checkout

🧩 PRODUCT PAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY SECTIONS)
1️⃣ HERO / ABOVE-THE-FOLD (Decision Zone)

Include:

Product Name (bold, clear)

One-line outcome-driven value proposition

Micro social proof (e.g. “Trusted by 2,000+ users”)

Primary CTA button:
“Proceed to Secure Checkout”

Mobile-first design
