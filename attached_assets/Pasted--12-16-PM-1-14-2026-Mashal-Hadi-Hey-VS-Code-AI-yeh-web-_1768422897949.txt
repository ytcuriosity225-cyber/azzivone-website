[12:16 PM, 1/14/2026] Mashal Hadi: Hey VS Code AI, yeh web project complete hai aur ready hai. Ab tu ye steps ek saath kare:

1) Build the project for production:
   - Run npm install, npm run build (ya project ke package manager ke hisaab se).  
   - Fix any TypeScript errors during the build.  

2) Deploy live server:
   - Deploy the project to the production/live environment (Vercel, Netlify, or Supabase hosting).  
   - Ensure all environment variables are set (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).  
   - Make sure client-side only uses anon key; server uses service_role key.  
   - Preserve UI layout and lazy-load images.  

3) Git Push:
   - Pull latest changes from main branch.  
   - Create a feature branch feature/live-deploy.

[12:19 PM, 1/14/2026] Mashal Hadi: Hey Replit AI, mujhe poori website live karni hai aur visible dashboard bhi chahiye jo backend/API ke saath fully connected ho. Follow these steps carefully without breaking UI design:

1) Setup & Build:
   - Install all dependencies (npm install / pnpm install / yarn install).  
   - Build the project for production (npm run build / yarn build).  
   - Ensure TypeScript passes without errors.  

2) Connect Supabase APIs:
   - Use supabaseClient.ts for client-side calls (anon key only).  
   - Ensure createOrder, fetchProducts, fetchHero, fetchReviews work correctly with the API.  
   - Admin endpoints must still use server-side service_role key securely.  

3) Dashboard UI:
   - Render the dashboard components on the live UI exactly as in code.  
   - Bind API responses to the dashboard so that products, orders, and reviews are visible in real-time.  
   - Ensure JWT/user_role checks for admin actions are enforced.  

4) Design Safety:
   - Do NOT change layouts, styles, or component positioning.  
   - Preserve image placeholders and lazy-loading.  
   - Keep all responsive/mobile UI intact.  

5) Deployment:
   - Make the website fully accessible via Replit’s live URL.  
   - Ensure all API routes are reachable and working correctly.  
   - Confirm the site is functional for both customers (checkout/orders) and admin (dashboard).  

6) Verification:
   - Test fetching products, creating orders, and viewing dashboard data.  
   - Ensure no sensitive keys (service_role) are exposed in frontend.  
   - Report live URL once deployment is complete.  

Do all these sequentially and ensure full functionality before marking it live. Preserve all UI/UX perfectly.
