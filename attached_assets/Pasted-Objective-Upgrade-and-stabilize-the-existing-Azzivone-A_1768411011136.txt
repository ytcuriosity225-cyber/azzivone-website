Objective
Upgrade and stabilize the existing Azzivone Admin Dashboard UI to function as a CMS-style control center that visually works end-to-end using mock data and is future-ready for backend (PHP REST APIs).
This is a UI + UX refinement task, NOT a redesign.
🧠 CONTEXT (VERY IMPORTANT)
The admin dashboard is already built in React + Tailwind + React Query
Backend APIs do NOT exist yet
Current issue: dashboard looks empty because API data is missing
Goal: make the admin feel fully alive, premium, and usable using mock data
This dashboard will later connect to real APIs without UI changes
✅ WHAT YOU MUST DO
1️⃣ DATA STRATEGY (CRITICAL)
Inject temporary mock data for:
Dashboard stats
Hero content
Products
Reviews
Mock data must match existing state shape & UI logic
Do NOT remove React Query or mutations
Do NOT hardcode UI text inside JSX — only feed data
2️⃣ DASHBOARD EXPERIENCE
Ensure the following visibly work:
Overview tab
Executive KPI cards animate and display:
Customers
Orders
Visitors
Location
Keep existing animations, icons, gradients
Content / Hero tab
Inputs must auto-fill with mock hero data
Live preview panel must render image/video if URL exists
CTA text editable
Logo URL editable
Product tab
Product dropdown must show at least 1 premium product
Editing:
Name
Price (Rs. 3500)
Inventory (300 units)
Status (Limited Stock)
Benefits list (editable bullets)
Reviews tab
Add review form must work visually
Reviews list must render stars + comments
🎨 DESIGN RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ KEEP
Existing layout
Colors (gold, off-white, soft neutrals)
Fonts (display + body)
Spacing
Animations
Premium “quiet luxury” vibe
❌ DO NOT
Do NOT change color palette
Do NOT add dark/black backgrounds
Do NOT redesign cards
Do NOT rename tabs
Do NOT remove Tailwind classes
Do NOT break responsiveness
Do NOT touch frontend website pages
🛑 HARD RESTRICTIONS
Breaking any rule below is failure.
❌ No new libraries
❌ No backend code
❌ No routing changes
❌ No folder restructuring
❌ No removal of existing components
❌ No visual regression
❌ No API URL changes
🧩 OUTPUT EXPECTATION
After completion:
Admin dashboard looks fully functional
CEO can explore it without errors
Mock data can later be replaced with real API responses
Zero impact on existing design or frontend pages
🏁 SUCCESS CRITERIA
If backend is plugged in later:
Only API base URL changes
No UI refactor required
Dashboard instantly becomes real
